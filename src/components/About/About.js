<p>Home  Website information  
The Tourism New Zealand website newzealand.com is the official tourism website for New Zealand. It features information that is relevant to travellers who are thinking about and actively planning a visit to New Zealand.

Through this site, potential visitors will be able to learn about the diversity of what New Zealand has to offer and how to make their visit a fantastic experience.

newzealand.com has an open content model and Tourism New Zealand encourages tourism businesses, previous travellers to New Zealand, and Kiwis to contribute content to the website to help future travellers plan their trip.

Contributing an article
Do you have a great New Zealand travel story to tell? Is there a must-do experience you recommend future travellers see or do? Have you got practical travel advice you want to share? If so, please create an article so that others can benefit from your knowledge and experience. Simply sign-up to create your account.

All article content submitted to the site for publication is reviewed by Tourism New Zealand for relevance, completeness and web hygiene factors (e.g. use of images). However, content contributed to the website by in large is published the way the author intended and all content is clearly attributed to the author.</p>
<p>
When an author is creating an article for newzealand.com they must ‘tag’ the article and can include up to five keywords or topics. The tags determine where on the website the article will surface (usually in multiple places) and help website users find content to meet their specific information needs. For example, an article about a recommended mountain biking experience in Queenstown could be tagged, Queenstown, mountain biking, adventure, and Summer. The same article could be found by a consumer if they are interested in any of these places, activities or topics..</p>
